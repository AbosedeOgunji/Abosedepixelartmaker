the pixel art maker has helped me to practice what I have learnt in the Google Africa Scholarship challenge course and has helped my reasearch skills, which i also imployed in doing this project, i was able to use JQuery to perform DOM manipulation, i was also able to link my HTML file correctly to my CSS file and the Google Hosted Libraries for JQuery and fonts. I also modified my HTML and CSS file for better presentation or outlook.
